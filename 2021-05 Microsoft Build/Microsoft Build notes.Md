## Build cloud-native applications that run anywhere
*Speakers: Jeff Hollan | Microsoft; Bec Lyons | Microsoft; Gabe Monroy | Microsoft* <br>
Cloud native refers to packaging applications into containers, deploying microservices and functions, exposing events and APIs. These cloud native features can help developers overcome challenges they frequently run into. Azure is now used by many companies for many different solutions. Azure offers Azure applications services that make managing applications very easy, with automated autoscaling, integration with GitHub, event routing and unified API managements. Microsoft now introduces Azure Arc, to run the application services on Kubernetes, on Azure but also on-premise or other cloud providers. Azure has publicly available app samples, which are blueprints for applications that can be run on Azure, which you can clone from GitHub into your Azure account. You can straight away start editing you app in a "codespace" (in browser), without having to do any lenght setup! The codespace, which looks like VScode, is fully integrated with GitHub and supports GitHub actions, letting you automate the build and CI/CD of your app.
Next, Jeff showed a serverless workflow (visual logic app), requiering minimal coding, letting him integrate many Azure services quickly. On of the feature of Azure Arc is allowing your app to be run anywhere, by making custom regions (e.g. Jeff-US, which is his personal laptop), letting you even run your app on-premise for when firewalls are an issue. (You have to register the device with Azure first to set up that region). As mentioned, this let's you build your apps on Azure, but deploy them anywhere using Kubernetes.
Bec discussed the operationalizing of containers in a complex application. Azure AKS lets you easily set up Kubernetes clusters, with configurations for networking, but also other integrations. The Azure portal lets you move configurations / updates easily using Azure Arc, which lets you replicate your GitHub changes (GitOps) to any on-premise clusters. By simply applying a GitHub repository to an empty cluster your can push your app to a cluster.

## How to become a software developer
*Speakers: Dolapo Martins | Software Engineer - Microsoft; Navya Prakash | Technical Program Manager - Microsoft ; Ivo Santos | Principal Software Engineering Manager - Microsoft* <br>
This session is a discussion about the skills necessary and pathways available to become a software engineer. 

**Q: How did you get started with programming?** A: Both software developers mentioned starting programming at a young age (middle school / 9 years old) with some web development (HTML/CSS) or game development (mainly copying). However, the host (Navya) started programming a bit later (end of high school). <br><br>
**Q: For someone trying to enter the field, what are the most important recommendations?** A: The panelists mention that focussing on the fundamentals (algo / data structures etc.) is very important as these have been very consistent over the last ~40 years, rather than the many tools that come out all the time. If your fundamentals are not good enough your knowledge will be shallow and you may not be successful. Ivo recommends something like C / C++ to learn the fundamentals of a lower level language (doesn't have to be very advanced, but will be a good experience), but also a object oriented languages (Java, C# or Python). Dolapo mentions that practicing logic tables (truth tables) and loops are very important basics to know well. Navya: many new developers now start with web development, letting you get started making apps faster but you have to make sure to learn the fundamentals as well. <br><br>
**Q: What do you look for on a resume/CV? Are people required to get a CS degree or are there other things you look for?** A: Ivo: As a hiring manager he looks either for a degree / academic background, but also for self-learners but he would look for signs that the candidate knows the fundamentals. As a self-learner you should complete courses, maintain a GitHub and build a project you're passionate about (e.g. games / business). Use your passionate project to go very deep into that topic. Delapo did multiple internships after her school projects to get into software development, which helped her to show work experience. The first internship/job is the most important, to show recruiters that you're able to do the job. Navya: Just putting your resume out there is important, but more important is being proactive and following up with people you've networked with. Dolapo mentions that when networking she finds it more important to introduce yourself as a person/engineer first, and talk about your resume later. <br><br>
**Q: Next topic, interviewing..., what is important in the process?** A: (Ivo) He usually doesn't use trivia but uses real-world examples when interviewing someone, and ask then how they would tackle it, and test it. He finds multithreading (and scalability) a very important topic in interviews, as the candidate has to think about an app that is accessed by thousands of users. Delapo likes to focus on design/structuring of code and the thinking process when developing software. She also agrees with Ivo that the load/usage of the app is very important and you constantly think about how your code affects the load/costs/complexity etc. Navya: We all get questions we can't answers, but the thinking process is very important. When she interview she likes the candidate to design something very broad (e.g. library or airport) and is very interested in their thought process but also the follow up question she gets from the candidate (it's important for the developer to figure out what the business/client wants!).
**Q: Certifications: How important are they?** A: (Ivo) Having a certification is a plus, as it shows that the person has taken the time to get familiar with the service. <br><br>
**Q: What kind of person makes a good software developer manager?** A: (Ivo) You have to like dealing with people and being interested in seeing other develop their careers. The manager has to be a role model, be able to deal with relationship problems and you have to care about people, and being good technically. (Navy) She needs to understand both the technical aspect, but also the business aspects (most important in her role). But the problem solving mindset and understanding the development process is important. Be able to talk in a technical and non-technical manner. Also being very organized is important. <br><br>
**Q: What makes someone a good software developer?** A: (Delapo) Being coachable and approachable. If you're working on a problem for a few hours and you're stuck, go and ask for help from a senior person (and later on you can teach others that skill!). On the other hand, being approachable to other people is important for the teamwork. (All) Knowing how to write good code is a prerequisite, but is also something that will develop along the way. The languages you know are important building blocks, but are not neccessarily what makes you good at your job. <br><br>
**Q: Soft skills, what do you expect from someone on the job?** A: (Ivo) Being coachable is a sign of strength, as it shows you can listen, and take feedback. Most software engineers are very smart people and could have problems to take feedback, and he mentions that there is always something to learn. On the other hand, be critical and not afraid to give feedback (speak up)! (Nayva) Trust yourself! <br><br>
**Q: What is one recommendation to give for someone with no coding skills to become a software engineer?** A: (Delapo) Being able to read and document code is very important. (Ivo) Set some career goals, where do you want to be in 5 years? Make a plan, get started and keep working on it. Make sure to keep building experiences during your career. Also, ask advice from people in the field. (Nayva) Write as much code as possible, you really refine your skill that way! (Don't focus to much on reading books/courses, but make sure to practice it as well)

## Core tools for a dev career: an introduction to Visual Studio Code and GitHub
*Speakers: Sana Ajani | Microsoft; Meaghan Lewis | Microsoft* <br>
**Sana Ajani: Introduction to VScode and new extensions:** Using Dev containers for Docker in VScode save time setting up an environment, and is very helpfull when teaching a course, so that everyone runs the same systems and dependencies. For this you will have to run docker, and install the remote container plugin on GitHub. GitHub has also been integrated in VScode, and in VScode you can login with your GitHub account, giving you some cool features. Once logged in, you can search all your GitHub code, through the VScode search bar, and once you find something interesting you can clone it directly! If a GitHub project contains a dev container, you can spin it up through VScode, without actually having to install that software on your computer, giving you a dev container specific for that language. You can even put VScode extensions and settings in the container, so that all student run the exact some VScode environment as well. The codetour extension lets you make/read a walkthough of the code, showing the files in the order you want to show them (e.g. for complex apps with many files). A codetour is more interactive than a README or simple PDF file. To make collaborative projects easier, they have made the liveshare extension, letting you create a link that lets someone else enter your VScode session. Not only let's this share your code and terminal, but there is also a chat function. This extension lets someone else edit your code, and it shows the changes someone else made.

**Meaghan Lewis: Introduction to GitHub:** Meaghan recommends everyone to create a GitHub profile and making a bio/profile page if you don't have one yet. Making a profile is as easy as making a GitHub repository with the same name as your profile name. She recommends using the "Explore" tab on GitHub to look for interesting projects you could contribute to.

## Learn how to Connect Azure Cosmos DB with Apache Kafka
*Speaker: Tim Berglund | Confluent* <br>
CosmosDB is Azure's NoSQL database that is horizontally scalable and schema-agnostic. CosmoDB was designed from the ground up for the cloud for multi-regions with super low latencies. CosmosDB runs on every region since many other Azure services rely on it. The database started out as a JSON / NoSQL database but has evolved to use other database models (Gremlin / Mongo / Cassandra APIs). Despite the different database models, the core data is still stored as JSON models, but you can use your own API + connector (e.g. MongoDB) for your data. Although the database is NoSQL, and many databases run their own query language, CosmosDB allows for the querying of data using the regular SQL language, since this is well known by most developers (and the rest is handled internally). Microsoft build connectors for Apache Kafka to connect services to CosmosDB. (Kafka Connect is the data streaming tool that connects Apache Kafka to other systems)

## Introducing Developer Velocity Lab to improve developers’ work and well-being
*Speaker: Nicole Forsgren | GitHub* <br>
The SPACE framework is a method to understand developer productivity. The 5 dimensions of productivity are Satisfaction and well-being, Performance, Activity, Communications and collaboration and finally Efficiency and flow. Understanding developer productivity allows you to improve on areas you previously didn't pay much attention to. It's hard to judge developers based on set metrics because everyone has different circumstances, schedules, or problems to solve. Knowing about productivity is not only usefull for managers, but can really help the developers as well. Satisfaction refers to the employee satisfaction and correlates well to developer efficiency. Performance metrics refer to the quality of the code (reliability, absence of bugs, ongoing service health) and the impact of code (customer satisfaction, customer adoption and retention, feature usage and cost reduction). > The best performance metric really depends on the situation. Activity are usually counts..., number of lines written, number of commits and operational activity. Communication/collaboration is all about discoverability of documentation and expertise, how fast work is intergrated, quality of collaborative work and other network metrics. Efficiency and flow are about the number of handoffs in a process, interruptions and other time measures in a system (things we can quantify). All metric can be grouped into individual level, the group level or at the system level. When using performance frameworks keep in mind to pick suitable metrics, not too many, take developer privacy into account and think about the biases and norms in the metrics.

## Harness the power of data in your applications with Azure
*Speakers: Rohan Kumar | Microsoft; Jason Anderson | Microsoft; Deborah Chen | Microsoft; Umur Cubukcu | Microsoft* <br>
Azure has various services to manage data on the cloud, including CosmosDB, Azure SQL, Azure database for PostgreSQL, Azure database for MySQL, Azure database for MariaDB and Azure cache for Redis. The new integrated cache, enterprise-grade security, linux emulator and enhancements to the free tier are the latest additions to the Azure Cosmos DB. The local linux emulator lets developers learn Cosmos DB locally for free. Azure Cosmos DB serverless is now generally available, letting developers run their applications with minimal planning, scalability with event-driven and elastic functions. Azure database serverless is great for requests that run infrequently since you don't pay for the time the server is idle. Azure's open source databases (PostgreSQL / MySQL) has grown 97% over the last year, running over 17 Billion transactions per day. Microsoft has extended new free tier offers for these services and have added Azure defender for data protection against irregular data access attempts. Hyperscale Citus lets you run scalable Postgres databases, even in the basic (free?) tier.

## Power BI for BI pros and Data Engineers
*Speaker: Priya Sathy | Microsoft*
In the last year, data has been very important in making business decisions and strategies, especially due to COVID-19. Power BI has been a great tool for companies in their data analytics. The Power BI strategy involves around letting every individual access their data (Power BI), but also fostering collaborations at the team level (e.g. teams, office), and at the enterprise level (scalability, security). For data engineers, Power BI has hundreds of connectors, to allows connections from any type of data. Power BI now has visible data transformations through visual graphs. Data prep workflows can be saved as common data models that can be integrated with your data lakes. Your reusable data analysis building blocks can be used by anyone in your organization, making future analyses faster. Some other capabilities that are coming soon are related to streaming data, e.g. from IoT devices, where Power BI can soon ingest data, analyze it, build reports of streaming data. Power BI (premium) offers backup and restore for disaster recovery or database migrations by using Azure data lakes. Automatic aggregations (most common queries are aggregates) and storing these in cache can improve the performance of your app! In the past you had to think about the aggregations you want to store, but now Power BI automatically stores the aggregations you will likely be interested in using AI predictions.
